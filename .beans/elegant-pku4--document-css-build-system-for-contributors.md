- How to add new CSS files
- How the build system processes CSS (postcss, layers, etc.)
- How to rebuild during development
- Common troubleshooting steps

Files to update:
- static/css/README.md (already has good content)
- documentation/content/Contributing/postcss.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md (if exists)
